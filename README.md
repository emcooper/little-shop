# Anduin: for all your Middle Earth needs

A basic e-commerce app with cart/order functionality and a sweet nerdy theme.

## Getting Started

```
git clone git@github.com:katiekeel/little-shop.git
cd little-shop
bundle install
```

## Developing

This is a [Rails app](http://rubyonrails.org/), which makes it easy to use and modify.

## Deploying/Publishing

If you want to host your shop on Heroku, instructions are [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/start).

## Features

Customers can shop for items, place them in their cart, check out, and see their order details afterward. They are able to view the contents of their cart and their order total before they check out. Users without an account who add things to their cart can maintain the same cart when logged in.

Site owner (admin) can manage products and categories, and is responsible for order processing and completion.
